# Facial-Recognition-Application

This Application uses Haar Cascade for Facial Detection and Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) Algorithm for Facial Recognition.
The faces-train.py is used to train the model on a particular dataset, in my case the dataset contains images of Sharhrukh Khan and my model was trained on his images.
The faces.py is used to test the model, i.e provide the image and the model would detect and recognise the person in the image.

To run the app, install python2 with OpenCV, numpy, pickle, pillow libraries.
